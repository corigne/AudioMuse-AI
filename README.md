# **AudioMuse-AI - Where Music Takes Shape** 

<p align="center">

</p>


AudioMuse-AI is an open-source, Dockerized environment that brings **automatic playlist generation** to your self-hosted music library. Using tools such as [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/), it performs **sonic analysis** on your audio files locally, allowing you to curate playlists for any mood or occasion without relying on external APIs.

Deploy it easily on your local machine with Docker Compose or Podman, or scale it in a Kubernetes cluster (supports **AMD64** and **ARM64**). It integrates with the main music servers' APIs such as [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), [LMS](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/tree/master), [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org/), and [Emby](https://emby.media). More integrations may be added in the future.

AudioMuse-AI lets you explore your music library in innovative ways, just **start with an initial analysis**, and you’ll unlock features like:
* **Clustering**: Automatically groups sonically similar songs, creating genre-defying playlists based on the music's actual sound.
* **Instant Playlists**: Simply tell the AI what you want to hear—like "high-tempo, low-energy music" and it will instantly generate a playlist for you.
* **Music Map**: Discover your music collection visually with a vibrant, genre-based 2D map.
* **Playlist from Similar Songs**: Pick a track you love, and AudioMuse-AI will find all the songs in your library that share its sonic signature, creating a new discovery playlist.
* **Song Paths**: Create a seamless listening journey between two songs. AudioMuse-AI finds the perfect tracks to bridge the sonic gap.
* **Sonic Fingerprint**: Generates playlists based on your listening habits, finding tracks similar to what you've been playing most often.
* **Song Alchemy**: Mix your ideal vibe, mark tracks as "ADD" or "SUBTRACT" to get a curated playlist and a 2D preview. Export the final selection directly to your media server.
* **Text Search**: search your song with simple text that can contains mood, instruments and genre like calm piano songs.

## Quick Start Deployment

Get AudioMuse-AI running in minutes with Docker Compose.

If you need more deployment example take a look at [DEPLOYMENT](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) page.

For a full list of configuration parameter take a look at [PARAMETERS](docs/PARAMETERS.md) page.

For the architecture design of AudioMuse-AI, take a look to the [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) page.

From `v1.0.0`, only PostgreSQL, Redis, and `TZ` configuration must still be configured via environment variables. All other configuration values are managed through the browser setup wizard and persisted in the database. For compatibility with legacy installations, environment variables are imported into the database automatically on first startup. The Setup Wizard is shown on clean installation as lending page and is also available later from the menu under Administration > Setup Wizard.

**Prerequisites:**
* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* A running media server (Jellyfin, Navidrome, Lyrion, or Emby)
* See [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements)

**Steps:**

1. **Create your environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp deployment/.env.example deployment/.env
   ```

   You can customize the setup by editing `deployment/.env` before startup. As a minimum, it is suggested to change the default database user and password, but you can also override other PostgreSQL and Redis connection parameters if needed:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI): `http://localhost:8000/apidocs/`
     (when authentication is enabled, log in via the Web UI first — `/apidocs/`
     is gated by the same JWT cookie as the rest of the app.)

4. **Run your first analysis:**
   - Navigate to "Analysis and Clustering" page
   - Click "Start Analysis" to scan your library
   - Wait for completion, then explore features like clustering and music map

5. **Stopping the services:**
```bash
docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml down
```
> **Important:** AudioMuse-AI is designed to work with PostgreSql v15 as in the deployment example. Different version could create error.

## AMD ROCm GPU Worker

This fork adds a dedicated AMD GPU worker built on ROCm + MIGraphX-accelerated ONNX Runtime. On an RX 7900 XTX the full analysis pipeline (CLAP + MusiCNN + Essentia mood + faster-whisper lyrics) runs at approximately 7 seconds per track -- roughly 25x faster than a CPU worker.

For full details see [docs/GPU.md](docs/GPU.md) and [docs/PARAMETERS.md](docs/PARAMETERS.md).

**Requirements:**
- ROCm 6.x or 7.x host driver (`amdgpu-install`)
- `amdgpu` group membership: `sudo usermod -aG video,render $USER`
- `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` available

**Build and start workers:**

```bash
# Minimal build
docker build -f Dockerfile.rocm -t audiomuse-ai:rocm .

# With faster-whisper lyrics backend and Essentia mood classifiers (recommended)
docker build -f Dockerfile.rocm \
  --build-arg WITH_FASTER_WHISPER=1 \
  --build-arg WITH_ESSENTIA_MOOD_MODELS=1 \
  -t audiomuse-ai:rocm .

# Scale to 3 workers (adjust to your core count)
docker compose -f docker-compose.amd-worker.yml up -d --scale audiomuse-worker=3
```

**RDNA 2 / RDNA 3 GFX version override** (set in `.env` or `docker-compose.amd-worker.yml`):

| Card generation | `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` |
|---|---|
| RDNA 2 (RX 6000 series) | `10.3.0` |
| RDNA 3 (RX 7000 series) | `11.0.0` |

**Optional: enable Essentia mood classifiers** (better calibrated than CLAP text-similarity):
```env
USE_ESSENTIA_MOOD_MODELS=1
ESSENTIA_MOOD_MODEL_DIR=/app/model/essentia-mood
```

**Optional: enable faster-whisper lyrics transcription:**
```env
LYRICS_WHISPER_MODEL_DIR=/app/model/faster-whisper-small
```

**Performance tip:** set `PER_SONG_MODEL_RELOAD=false` to keep ONNX sessions alive across an album instead of reloading after every track. MIGraphX JIT compilation cost is amortised across the album, yielding ~7s/track at steady state.

## **Hardware Requirements**

AudioMuse-AI has been tested on:
* **Intel**: HP Mini PC with Intel i5-6500, 16 GB RAM and NVMe SSD
* **ARM**: Raspberry Pi 5, 8 GB RAM and NVMe SSD / Mac Mini M4 16GB / Amphere based VM with 4core 8GB ram

**Minimum requirements:**
* CPU: 4-core Intel with AVX2 support (usually produced in 2015 or later) or ARM
* RAM: 8 GB RAM
* DISK: NVME SSD storage

For more information about the GPU deployment requirements have a look to the [GPU](docs/GPU.md) page.

> **IMPORTANT**: If you use virtualization (e.g. Proxmox), make sure to pass through the host CPU. QEMU's virtual CPU lacks AVX2 support, which will prevent AudioMuse-AI from starting.

## **Docker Image Tagging Strategy**

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and publishes Docker images with the following tags:

* **`:latest`**
  Stable build from the **main** branch.
  **Recommended for most users.**

* **`:devel`**
  Development build from the **devel** branch.
  May be unstable — **for testing and development only.**

* **`:X.Y.Z`** (e.g. `:1.0.0`, `:0.1.4-alpha`)
  Immutable images built from **Git release tags**.
  **Ideal for reproducible or pinned deployments.**

* **`-noavx2`** variants
  Experimental images for CPUs **without AVX2 support**, using legacy dependencies.
  **Not recommended** unless required for compatibility.

* **`-nvidia`** variants
  Images that support the use of GPU for both Analysis and Clustering.
  **Not recommended** for old GPU.
